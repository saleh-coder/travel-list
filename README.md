# Travel List - React Study Project

This is a simple project to practice React and frontend development.  
The goal is to build a basic app to list travel items, starting with a static layout and evolving as I learn.

---

## About the project

- Created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- Implements a basic layout with functional React components.
- Currently in development, with only the initial structure and static components.
- Meant to understand React organization, JSX, components, and React flow.
- Not a finished project or ready for production.

## Current components

- `Logo` - heading with emojis
- `Form` - placeholder area for future form
- `PackingList` - static list placeholder
- `Stats` - footer with count info placeholder

---

## How to run locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Planned next steps

- Make the list dynamic by adding items through the form
- Manage state with React Hooks
- Improve styling with CSS
- Separate components into individual files
- Implement features like marking items as packed

## Note

This project is my personal learning playground. Donâ€™t be surprised by frequent commits or rapid changes â€” itâ€™s all part of the study process.
