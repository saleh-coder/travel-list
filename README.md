# Travel List - React Study Project

A simple React app to manage a packing list for travel, created as a learning project to practice React fundamentals and component-based architecture.

---

## About the project

- Built with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- Modular structure: each component (`Logo`, `Form`, `PackingList`, `Item`, `Stats`, `App`) is in its own file under `/src/components`
- Features implemented:
  - Add, toggle, and delete packing items
  - Sort items by input order, description, or packed status
  - Clear entire list with user confirmation
  - Dynamic stats displaying total items, packed count, and packing progress percentage
- Focus on React Hooks (`useState`), derived state, component reusability, and state lifting
- Still a learning project, not production-ready

## Components overview

- `App` â€” main app container, manages state and handlers
- `Logo` â€” app header with emojis and title
- `Form` â€” input form to add new packing items
- `PackingList` â€” displays sorted list of items with controls
- `Item` â€” individual packing list item with toggle and delete buttons
- `Stats` â€” summary footer with packing statistics and dynamic messages
